Hi, my name is Kevin. However, I quite frequently go by the alias 'kabton' (which is just a clever amalgamation of my first name, middle name and surname). I am a fellow with quite a few interests/hobbies which include but are not limited to:

* Computers/Hardware technology
* Programing languages and the Theory of Computation (Analysis of Algorithms, Time Complexity, Space Complexity etc.)
* The Sciences (CS, Physics, Math, Biology, Medical Sciences etc.)
* Music ( I am a hardcore listener and creator of music (musician))
* Reading
* Philosophy
* Aviation

This is my space to discuss any of these interests (and more) in any way I see fit. I hope you appreciate and hopefully learn something new as I share the knowledge that I have discovered and will discover.

I am a firm believer in self improvement and broadening one's horizons. I sincerely believe one should not be satisfied with the world as it is presented to them, but one should continually question EVERYTHING. Accept nothing just because some authority tells you to or everybody else seems to accept it. Every good idea in this world should be able to stand up to scrutiny. 

I know, I sound somewhat like a rebel (in truth, I consider myself to be), but I like peace and harmony too! And if you take the time out to get to know me, you'll find out that I'm a pretty affable guy.

I hope you will find my space knowledgeable and enriching as that is what I hope to make it. From time to time, I might post details on the most current projects that I am working on so be sure to check them out.

Lastly, I do consulting, web and software development for various persons and organizations. So if you have a project that is along
those lines (or if you just wanna to say hi :) ), please be sure to <a href = "/contact_kts">contact me. </a>

One love!
