<h1>Winning From Within - Erica Ariel Fox</h1>


In her book, Erica Fox outlines methods that can be used to find our 'center' and be better in our reaction to life's situations.


>“Listen to your mother. A meal becomes good by starting with quality instructions. It becomes great when you add a quality chef.”


 She mentions that knowing the rules, and what to do isn't enough when you are faced with life's situations, as there are many people who know what to do, but don't follow it when faced with a situation that requires them to act.
Fox introduces the concept of the performance gap, which describes how people approach a situation, any situation, in life. In many people's minds, there is an ideal way of how they see themselves acting in a situation. But there is also the actual way in which they act in this situation; In the heat of the moment when one doesn't have time to think about recipes. The difference between your ideal way of approaching a situation and your actual way is called the performance gap. The greater this difference, the bigger the performance gap. the smaller this difference, the smaller the performance gap.

Closing the performance gap is the desirable outcome as it means we have found our center and we are acting how we truly want to. She also posits that rules are not enough to close the performance gap; We need to take the time out to become quality chefs.
We become quality chefs by examining the factors at our core that are responsible for how we act the way we do. Fox refers to these as the big four. There are certain qualities, or archetypes, that seem to be at play in most individuals and are exuded to varying degrees. These qualities come naturally to people and aren't necessarily consciously learned.

Fox mentions that although there might be an inexhaustible list of qualities, there are four main ones that seem to be central to the individual. These are:
<ol>
<li>The Dreamer</li>
<li>The Thinker</li>
<li>The Lover</li>
<li>The Warrior</li>
</ol>

Using the corporate executive as an analogy, She likens the dreamer to the CEO, who is responsible for thinking about the 'big picture' and general direction of his company. He imagines what the future will be like and how his company can take advantage of it. The thinker is the chief financial operator. The CFO is concerned with the analysis and the logistics concerned with keeping the company financially viable. The lover is the VP- head of human resources. This Lover is concerned with caring for people and seeing how people can amicably work together in the interest of the company while being fulfilled. The warrior is the chief operating officer. The CFO is the person who makes things work. This person is not afraid to get his hands dirty and does what needs to be done.

*Wait, there's more...*

These qualities are what constitutes the human ego. As individuals, we use the big four to varying degrees and we tend to lean toward 1 or 2 qualities while neglecting or failing to utilize the others. This probably happens because of how we were socialized as children. We tend to also develop a 'picture' of ourselves during this socialization process, which cements our favorite qualities of the big 4. Fox posits that a big step toward closing the performance gap is understanding these 4 qualities and striving to use them in equal proportions when approached with life's situations. She also mentions that there might be times when we need to have a sort of negotiation process among the qualities as the situation demands.

She further states that in western cultures, the big 4 tends to be conflated and placed on a pedestal as the entirety of the individual. She, however, refutes this and says that while they are an integral part of the individual, there is, in fact, more than the big 4.

*Meet the directors.*

Like the corporate executives, the big 4 is in need of a group of mature, dispassionate persons who are able to look beyond their noses and provide wisdom and foster a culture of circumspectness. Fox refers to these as the transformers. There are 3 main transformers:
<ol>
<li>The Lookout</li>
<li>The Captain</li>
<li>The Voyager</li>
</ol>

The lookout is responsible for ensuring that you are connected to your center of well-being, which is the state in which you are one with the internal self and the external self. This director is also responsible for monitoring the big four, taking in information through an unbiased lens, and passing it on to his fellow director. The captain is responsible for taking internal information about the big 4 from the lookout and also taking information from the outside. The multiplicity of his information sources enables the captain to utilize the big four in the most balanced and effective way, while drawing from your values and wisdom contained in your center, to get desired results. The Voyager is concerned with growth. He charts a path where no path has been before and is always moving ahead, regardless of failures or setbacks. The Voyager keeps on moving and realizes that a richer inner life and outer life is integral to his success. 

Winning from within gives us insight into how we can become better at handling the plethora of situations that flood us daily in our fast-paced world. It also awakens us to the possibilities of growth and new frontiers waiting to be explored.
